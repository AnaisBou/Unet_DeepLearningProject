# Understanding and Implementing Diffusion Models for Image Generation on CelebA

## Introduction
This report explores the implementation of **diffusion models** for image generation using the CelebA dataset. The project focuses on understanding the stochastic nature of diffusion processes and their reversal, facilitated by the integration of U-Net architectures for feature extraction and reconstruction.

## Theoretical Background

### Diffusion Models
Diffusion models are probabilistic generative frameworks that iteratively add noise to data (forward process) and remove it (reverse process) to synthesize samples.

#### Forward Diffusion Process
The forward process progressively corrupts data \(x_0\) by adding Gaussian noise. For discrete time steps \(t\), this is expressed as:
\[
q(x_t | x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{\alpha_t} x_{t-1}, (1 - \alpha_t)I),
\]
where:
- \(x_t\) is the noisy data at step \(t\),
- \(\alpha_t\) determines the noise scale.

In the continuous-time limit, the process is modeled by the following **Itô SDE**:
\[
dx = f(x, t) dt + g(t) dW,
\]
where:
- \(f(x, t)\) is the drift coefficient,
- \(g(t)\) is the diffusion coefficient,
- \(dW\) is the Wiener process.

#### Reverse Diffusion Process
The reverse process denoises data iteratively. It is governed by the reverse-time SDE:
\[
dx = \left[f(x, t) - g(t)^2 \nabla_x \log p_t(x)\right] dt + g(t) d\bar{W},
\]
where:
- \(\nabla_x \log p_t(x)\) is the score function (gradient of the log probability),
- \(d\bar{W}\) is the reverse Wiener process.

The score function is approximated by a neural network \(s_\theta(x_t, t)\), trained to predict the gradient of the log probability.

#### Score-Based Generative Modeling
The score function \(s_\theta(x_t, t)\) is optimized using the following loss:
\[
\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_{t, x_t} \left[\|s_\theta(x_t, t) - \nabla_x \log p_t(x_t)\|_2^2\right].
\]

### U-Net Architecture
The U-Net architecture enables efficient feature extraction and reconstruction. It has:
1. **Contracting Path**: Extracts hierarchical features using convolutions and downsampling.
2. **Expansive Path**: Reconstructs the data using upsampling and concatenation with skip connections.

Mathematically, the output feature map at layer \(l\) is given by:
\[
h_l = \text{ReLU}(\text{Conv}(h_{l-1}) + \text{Skip}(h_{L-l})),
\]
where:
- \(\text{Conv}\) represents convolution operations,
- \(\text{Skip}(h_{L-l})\) is the feature map from the corresponding contracting layer.

## Dataset Preparation
The CelebA dataset contains over 200,000 aligned facial images with 40 annotated attributes. Preprocessing steps include:
1. **Resizing**: Images are resized to \(64 \times 64\).
2. **Normalization**: Pixel values are scaled to \([-1, 1]\).
3. **Augmentation**: Random horizontal flips improve generalization.

## Model Implementation

### Gaussian Fourier Projection
To encode time \(t\) into a high-dimensional representation, we use Gaussian Fourier embeddings:
\[
\phi(t) = [\sin(W \cdot t), \cos(W \cdot t)],
\]
where:
- \(W \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I)\) is a matrix of Gaussian-sampled weights.

These embeddings allow the model to capture temporal dependencies effectively.

### U-Net Based Score Network
The U-Net is augmented to integrate time embeddings. The score function \(s_\theta(x_t, t)\) is parameterized as:
\[
s_\theta(x_t, t) = \text{U-Net}(x_t, \phi(t)),
\]
where:
- \(x_t\) is the noisy input,
- \(\phi(t)\) represents the time embeddings.

### Reverse-Time SDE Solver
The reverse-time SDE solver removes noise iteratively. Using the **Euler-Maruyama method**, the update step is:
\[
x_{t-\Delta t} = x_t + \left[f(x_t, t) - g(t)^2 s_\theta(x_t, t)\right] \Delta t + g(t) \sqrt{\Delta t} z,
\]
where \(z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)\) is random noise.

## Training Procedure

### Loss Function
The training objective minimizes the discrepancy between the predicted noise and the true noise:
\[
\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_{x, t, z} \left[\left\| s_\theta(x_t, t) + \frac{z}{\sigma_t} \right\|_2^2\right],
\]
where:
- \(x_t = x_0 + z \cdot \sigma_t\) is the perturbed data,
- \(z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)\) is Gaussian noise,
- \(\sigma_t\) is the noise scale at time \(t\).

### Training Workflow
1. **Data Perturbation**: Noise is added to input images based on a random time step.
2. **Score Prediction**: The model predicts the added noise.
3. **Optimization**: Weights are updated to minimize the loss over multiple epochs.

## Results and Analysis

### Generated Images
The model generates realistic and diverse facial images. Generated samples exhibit high fidelity and variation across attributes.

### Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance is evaluated using:
- **Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)**: Measures similarity between real and generated images.
- **Diversity Score**: Quantifies variation among generated samples.

| Metric       | Value       |
|--------------|-------------|
| FID (↓)      | **XX.XX**   |
| Diversity (↑)| **XX.XX**   |
