## Introduction
This project explores the theoretical underpinnings and practical implementation of **diffusion models** for image generation, using the CelebA dataset. Diffusion models rely on **stochastic differential equations (SDEs)** to model the forward noise-adding process and its reverse for denoising. The U-Net architecture plays a pivotal role in extracting hierarchical features and reconstructing the original data from noisy inputs.

## Theoretical Background

### Diffusion Models
Diffusion models are a generative framework that progressively adds noise to data (forward process) and then reverses this process to generate new samples.

#### Forward Diffusion Process
The forward process corrupts the data by adding Gaussian noise in \(T\) discrete steps:
\[
q(x_t | x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{\alpha_t} x_{t-1}, (1 - \alpha_t)I),
\]
where:
- \(x_0\) is the original data,
- \(x_t\) is the data at time step \(t\),
- \(\alpha_t\) controls the noise scale.

In continuous form, this process is represented as an **Itô stochastic differential equation (SDE)**:
\[
dx = f(x, t)dt + g(t)dW,
\]
where \(f(x, t)\) is the drift coefficient, \(g(t)\) is the diffusion coefficient, and \(dW\) represents the Wiener process.

#### Reverse Diffusion Process
The reverse process denoises the data iteratively. The reverse-time SDE is given by:
\[
dx = \left[f(x, t) - g(t)^2 \nabla_x \log p_t(x)\right]dt + g(t)d\bar{W},
\]
where:
- \(\nabla_x \log p_t(x)\) is the score function (gradient of the log probability),
- \(d\bar{W}\) is the reverse Wiener process.

#### Score-Based Generative Modeling
The reverse process relies on estimating the score function \(\nabla_x \log p_t(x)\), learned using neural networks:
\[
\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_{t, x_t} \left[\|s_\theta(x_t, t) - \nabla_x \log p_t(x_t)\|_2^2\right].
\]
This loss ensures the model predicts the noise added at each step.

### U-Net Architecture
The U-Net architecture is integral to extracting hierarchical features for score prediction. It consists of:
1. **Contracting Path**: Captures contextual information at multiple scales using convolution and downsampling.
2. **Expansive Path**: Reconstructs data with upsampling and concatenation, integrating global and local features via skip connections.

Mathematically, the feature maps at each layer \(l\) are computed as:
\[
h_l = \text{ReLU}(\text{Conv}(h_{l-1}) + \text{Skip}(h_{L-l})),
\]
where \(\text{Skip}(h_{L-l})\) represents the feature map from the symmetric layer in the contracting path.

## Dataset Preparation
The CelebA dataset comprises over 200,000 aligned facial images annotated with 40 attributes. Preprocessing involves:
1. **Resizing**: Convert all images to \(64 \times 64\) resolution.
2. **Normalization**: Scale pixel values to \([-1, 1]\).
3. **Augmentation**: Random flips to improve model generalization.

## Model Implementation

### Gaussian Fourier Projection
To encode time steps \(t\) into a high-dimensional space, Gaussian Fourier features are used:
\[
\phi(t) = [\sin(W \cdot t), \cos(W \cdot t)],
\]
where \(W \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I)\) is a matrix of Gaussian-sampled weights. These embeddings enhance the temporal representation for score prediction.

### U-Net Based Score Network
The U-Net backbone is augmented with time embeddings injected at each layer. The score function \(s_\theta(x_t, t)\) is parameterized as:
\[
s_\theta(x_t, t) = \text{U-Net}(x_t, \phi(t)),
\]
where \(\phi(t)\) represents the time embeddings.

### Reverse-Time SDE Solver
The reverse-time SDE solver iteratively removes noise from a randomly initialized sample. Using the Euler-Maruyama method, the solver updates samples as:
\[
x_{t-\Delta t} = x_t + \left[f(x_t, t) - g(t)^2 s_\theta(x_t, t)\right]\Delta t + g(t)\sqrt{\Delta t}z,
\]
where \(z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)\) is random noise.

## Training Procedure

### Loss Function
The training objective minimizes the error in predicting the added noise. The normalized loss is defined as:
\[
\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_{x, t, z} \left[\left\| s_\theta(x_t, t) + \frac{z}{\sigma_t} \right\|_2^2\right],
\]
where:
- \(x_t = x_0 + z \cdot \sigma_t\) is the perturbed image,
- \(z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)\) is Gaussian noise,
- \(\sigma_t\) is the noise scale at time \(t\).

### Training Workflow
1. **Data Perturbation**: Apply noise to training images based on random time steps.
2. **Score Prediction**: Predict the added noise using the U-Net-based score network.
3. **Loss Optimization**: Update model weights to minimize the training loss over multiple epochs.
